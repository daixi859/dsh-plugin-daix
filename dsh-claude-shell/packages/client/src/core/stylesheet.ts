 * Park a sibling's untagged stylesheet so no package's bookkeeping can take it.
 *
 * The client module system claims every untagged `<style>` in the document
 * for the package whose factory has just materialized (`claimStyles`, reading
 * `style:not([data-plugin])`), and that package's next reload removes every
 * tag carrying its id (`removeOwnedStyles`). A sibling that mounts its sheet
 * from `apply()` — after its own materialization — leaves it untagged, so the
 * next package to materialize would take it into custody and delete it at
 * that package's next reload, stripping the sibling's rules off a page that
 * keeps running. Every untagged sheet that is not this package's own is
 * therefore parked under a resting tag: the tag carries a slash, can never
 * equal a package name, and matches no removal step, so the sibling keeps its
 * sheet — and its own teardown still removes that sheet by reference when its
 * generation ends. Two moments call this, because a sweep never waits for the
 * skin: the module scope of packages/client/src/entry.ts, the only code of ours that runs
 * before the sweep of our own materialization, and the head watch below, which
 * sees a sheet arriving after it.
