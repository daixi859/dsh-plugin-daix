 * host renders that menu's list itself and unmounts it on close, so this
 * surface re-identifies the list every pass and injects our container at its
 * head: the first child INSIDE the list, never a sibling of the host's rows.
 * The list is content-matched (account/host-menu.ts), so the permission
 * control's menu and the model picker's submenu are never touched.
 *
 * A host without one (Web) gets a self-built trigger and popover
 * (account-footer.ts); that popover's body is the container.
 *
 * A closed list leaves no reference behind: the next open builds a fresh
 * container. A host re-render that merely empties the list is healed by
 * re-inserting the node we still hold, so our rows survive it unchanged.
