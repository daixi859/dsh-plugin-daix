/**
 * The conversation header's title row, lifted into the desktop caption row.
 *
 * The Windows shell hands the window's top 40px to a caption row and lets the
 * columns run up under it (D31), so that row is the one place a session title
 * can sit above everything else — the row the collapsed sidebar's own button
 * and the view-tab strip (view-tabs.css) already use. Everything lifted here
 * belongs to the host, so nothing is moved between parents: each piece is
 * stamped and placed with `position: fixed`, and the row it leaves reflows on
 * its own — the title cluster keeps the preset picker, which closes up to the
 * row's left edge (D52).
 *
 * Both placements are measured, never assumed: the caption buttons' reserve
 * comes from desktopBand (D28), the row's own inset from the title row, and
 * the strip's box from wherever view-tabs put it. A side whose room is too
 * small stays in the row, which is the stylesheets' base rule — a placement
 * that does not fit writes nothing, so the fallback needs no restoring. The
 * title and the controls are decided apart, because a window wide enough for
 * one of them is often too narrow for the other, and either cluster may be
 * missing (the corner seat is empty while the right sidebar is open, whose own
 * chrome carries those controls) without the other losing its place.
 *
 * The row the title leaves rises: with the words gone it holds only controls,
 * and the inset the host gives a row that also carried a title would leave
 * them floating a title's height below the caption row.
 *
 * macOS is left alone: its shell pads no content and the header already draws
 * its first line inside the traffic-light strip, so there is nothing to lift.
 *
 * The marks: `data-dsh-header-band` on <body> carries which parts left the row
 * (`title`, `actions`, or both) and header-band.css keys every rule on it; the
 * three element stamps keep the stylesheet free of host class names.
 *
 * @param ctx - client context.
 * @param ui - shared handle table.
 * @returns teardown.
